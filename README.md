# altlife-site

This is the main website for `https://altv.life/`. We figured it'd be wise to keep this open source so it can be updated and mainted fairly easily.

### Development Environment Setup

Run these first:

```
npm install
npm install -g http-server
```

Open a command prompt for this repo.

```
npm run start
```

Should open two consoles; minimize them. Your browser should open to the page.
Refresh whenever you make changes.
