# altlife-site

This is the main website for `https://altv.life/`. We figured it'd be wise to keep this open source so it can be updated and mainted fairly easily.

### Development Environment Setup

```
npm install -g http-server
```

Open a command prompt for this repo.

```
http-server . -c-1
```

Navigate to one the URLs that are shown in the comman prompt; and add `/index.html` at the end. Ta-Da. Now you can see the website.
